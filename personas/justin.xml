  <excerpt>As Peter is waiting for his dessert, he picks up a magazine in a different language than his that somebody has forgotten on a shelf. He doesn\'t understand the headers and takes a picture of one of the headers with his phone. The header is automatically translated for him. Peter then stows the magazine away as he spots a very interesting contemporary painting on the wall next to the table. He quickly opens the artist application on his mobile for recognising paintings and photos, and the name and information about the artist is automatically retrieved as he takes a photo of it. He continues to search for more information about the artist in the browser just as the dessert is served to him.</excerpt>
