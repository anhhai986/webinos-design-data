<persona name="Gary" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/irisuser/webinos/wp2/personas/gary.jpg" >
  <activities>Presently unemployed, recently fired, not in a very happy mood. Gary angrily remembers his former career as task leader of the information technology unit, working for over 25 years in desktop and networking support, and building a professional websites for more than 10 years. Until he was discharged without consideration of his long-serving loyalty to the company's work.</activities>
  <attitudes>An experienced PC user, who happily uses a PC for everyday tasks. His always demands new challenges capable of stimulating his natural curiosity and matching his desire for personal improvement. In particular, he enjoys improving his knowledge of computers and the Internet every day.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Already fed by a good knowledge of PC and Internet, he can easily prove the obtained knowledge through many certificates related to his job. However, despite his existing achievements he still has a desire to obtain new certification as evidence of his tireless appetite for learning.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Due to the perceived unjust treatment by his former employer, Gary first idea is to retaliate for his dismissal by deleting company data. After a second thought, the idea remains the same! It is impossible for him to forgive such insensitive behaviour by the company. Since he is able to access the computer system, a huge amount of damage is eagerly achievable.</motivations>
  <skills>Gary knows the company's internal network and his old user account is still working (the company should have disabled it promptly, but did not). He can directly access and delete relevant files or embed a malicious script in a routine program to plant a logic bomb on the company server.</skills>
