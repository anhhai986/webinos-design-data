<persona name="Jessica" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="Jessica.jpg" >
  <activities>Jessica lives and works in California. She is in charge of developing a mobile application for diabetes, and a business co-founder. The diabetes application is being written for iPhone and Android platforms. The diabetes application is easy to use. Many diabetes people who are not computer-addicted are using it. It enables the planning, monitoring, and follow-up of diabetes patients via smart-phones. The application captures blood sugar and insulin measurements, and reminds the patient about when to do the measurements. All personal and medical data is also relayed and stored securely in an online application server, with a back office for diabetes research professionals. There is also a patented diet calculator included in the mobile application. The application was the winner of the "Apps for Medicare" competition at the White House, in Washington, DC, in 2010, because it has been embraced by the Diabetes community, General Practitioners, and Insurance Companies. She has based the data models on the HL7-standard as much as possible. A stringent and flexible privacy policy, in which the individual diabetes patient is in full control of who can access and use the data, has been a requirement for the patients to trust the system. In the picture above she is in the medicare technology conference where she received the "Apps for Medicare" award.

She is a traditional application developer that develops software clients for two smart-phone platforms. She keeps herself up-to-date on new technologies, applies them when writing new software and she knows what the competitors are doing. She is a diligent person, and carefully implements and tests the applications and she wants to understand the technologies before applying them. As a member of HL7, she is also a privacy-aware developer. She is very committed, systematic, and organised. She helps people make informed choices about their health. She likes to structure information and data, elicit requirements, and to delegate some tasks to the user and other tasks to the system. She communicates with a variety of people working with diabetes treatment, care, and research. She is a user-conscious developer, involving users as participants in her work, and she also has a user forum. Although she is user-centred she has a preference to mix it with model-driven development techniques, too. She models tasks and domain objects. She also models the context of use - as means to understand the users' everyday activities surrounding their diabetes problem.</activities>
  <attitudes>Creating trust, keeping her promises, and maintaining integrity are key values for Jessica. Being able to help other people means a lot for her. After her graduation she worked three years as engineer for United Nations and Save the Children in Africa to help governments and people. When she came back to the US, she realised she wanted to continue helping people with their health problems. She contacted some other like-minded through the university alumni, co-founded the company, got venture capital onboard in the round A funding, and further institutional investors from the health insurance sector onboard in round B. Integrity and customer-intimacy are key values for Jessica, and this is why the investors have been backing in her. She is very likeable and social one-on-one, but quite private and shy in larger crowds.

Although technically strong, she dislikes HTML and web development. Jessica feels that making more of the system open on the web implies much less control over the UI. She also believes the system becomes more open to attackers in general so her system must be very secure, have 100% uptime, and adhere to the best privacy policies. She also needs full control over every pixel on the screen, and the connection to the insulin meter.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Jessica isn't athletic, but she is naturally talented at maths. She uses her maths skills to draw 2D and 3D graphics and curves in ways that some of her colleagues are unable to grasp. She enjoys integrating with low-level sensors, visualising medical data as 3D-charts, and in encoding and decoding data. Her natural talent for plotting such data on the screen, are one of the reasons to the product success.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>She is highly motivated by the desire to engage and interact with patients, relatives, and healthcare professionals. As a result, she goes to great lengths to ensure her customers are happy. It inspires her to be able to spend many consecutive hours per day in front of her laptops to improve the applications using Eclipse and XCode. She becomes even more committed, the closer she gets to a user forum meeting.

Jessica burns to deliver the perfect, robust product. She frequently tests the applications. Being able to help each individual certainly boosts her energy level. Progress and improvement makes her happy, while misery and deterioration makes her anxious and less effective.

Jessica considers reduced quality of data as a direct threat to their business. Errors and loss of data over time could lead to a court case, or media coverage, which could bring the entire company to the brink. Storing the same data at multiple locations is a solution for them. Privacy is important.</motivations>
  <skills>Jessica is a specialist in Objective C and Java programming. She writes Objective C code in XCode for the iPhone app, and Java for Dalvik on Android. Jessica is also familiar with information visualisation and UI widget libraries associated with iPhone and Android platforms.

Jessica is adept at working with many hand-sets, but is unfamiliar with Nokia and Sony Ericsson hand-set development because she has never had need to do this.</skills>

    <narrative>Jessica's diabetes application has 750000 users in which 60% are on iPhone and 40% are on Android. She is legally obliged to protect all of the personal and medical data, and to make sure that the patients, relatives, and healthcare professionals are kept up-to-date with the data from each patient.  One risk is that patients incorrectly read the insulin dosage due to visual impairment. Another risk is that the measurements on blood sugar and insulin measurements are simply incorrect or has a wrong time stamp. If this happens over a consecutive period of time, then this may trigger fake alarms, incorrect treatments, or lead to serious health issues.</narrative>
