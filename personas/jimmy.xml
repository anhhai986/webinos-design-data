<persona name="Jimmy" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="Jimmy.jpg" >
  <activities>Jimmy's life is software development and Internet services. He is a self-employed professional software developer for mobile applications but he also spends his leisure time on writing plug-ins for his home equipment.

Jimmy is a passionate and experienced professional software developer. His focus is on mobile applications and Web applications. His experience covers the iPhone, Android and further technologies. He writes new applications and ports them to different platforms. He does software development for quite some years. Apart from that, he is a passionate and successful blogger.</activities>
  <attitudes>When developing software, Jimmy prefers open source. For him it is important to control what is going on in the software he uses. He chooses his tool chain and makes architectural decisions for his software accordingly. He keeps all the source code he once wrote and reuses fragments of it in other projects whenever it makes sense. For him, his source code is his own treasury of valuables he has created in his life. He always wants to have access to it and reuse whenever useful. He has no notion of braking the law by this behaviour. He just wants to implement good and working applications without reimplementing things he already implemented.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Jimmy follows a pragmatic hands-on design and implementation approach. He is much more into trying out things rather than spending time on theory. As he is interested in new technologies and new market opportunities he always stays up-to-date in his field. Jimmy enjoys experimenting with new technology and he adapts quickly. He learns best by just trying out things. Apart from that, he knows how to make money from the applications he writes, as he sells some mobile applications on an application store.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Jimmy is font of software-controlled gadgets which interact with other devices on his home network. He makes use of his professional knowledge to implement plug-ins and extensions for his home equipment. This allows him to let all the devices do what he needs.</motivations>
  <skills>Jimmy implements low-level functional details. Since he has deep knowledge on how things work, he can reverse-engineer software and take special features of target devices into account.</skills>
  <intrinsic>Jimmy uses his standard design and development tools and processes to model and make sense of security issues.  Sometimes he finds thinking about security tedious, and will re-use settings and designs where he thinks this is appropriate.  This seems more efficient than thinking deeply about intricate details.

Although the different ways his software might be used can be overwhelming, thinking about them gets him thinking about what some of his target users might go through when setting up and running his applications.  At times, however, this appreciation can lead him to make decisions which err too much towards their freedom of action rather than the best decision given their implicit security and privacy expectations.</intrinsic>
  <contextual>Thinking about the many different contexts can be taxing, particularly given the tools available to Jimmy are not a perfect fit for this job.  Unfortunately, different contexts are not Jimmy's only worry.  The problems associated with things like categorising and structuring security information, and the discussions sometimes Jimmy has to have with colleagues, means making any sort of security design decision can forever.

These considerations mean that, in the cold light of day, Jimmy is forced to make decisions that might lead to inappropriate user behaviours.  This causes some angst when having to trade-off user freedom with what he considers an appropriate level of security when deciding default settings.</contextual>
