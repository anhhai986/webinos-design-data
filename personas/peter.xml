<persona name="Peter" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="Peter.jpg" >
  <activities>Peter is an older gentleman, single and without many family commitments. He is fairly wealthy and enjoys spending his time and money on his interests: music, art and cars. He has a senior position at a large financial company, but when he is out of work he rarely thinks about his job.

Peter collects all the objects related to his interests - albums, paintings and cars - and would like to increase his access to them through new technology.</activities>
  <attitudes>Peter's well-paid job has allowed him to concentrate on the things that he loves: art, music and his main obsession: cars.

Peter likes using technology to further these interests. He spends considerable amounts of his leisure time driving, reading about cars and buying accessories and upgrades. He expects technology to help bridge the gap between his interests, so that he can enjoy art and music while on the move. Peter's lack of family commitments allows him to spend even more time on his hobbies. He relies on technology to let him organise and use his enormous music collection.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Peter is familiar with technology and no stranger to electronic media such as music and radio.

Peter is patient with technology and is willing to explore a new interface and follow pop-up instructions before he achieves his main objectives.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Peter is primarily interest-driven. He wants to use technology to bring his interests to his daily commute as well as letting him enjoy art and music whenever he has a spare moment, or whenever he comes across something new that he likes.</motivations>
  <skills>Peter has a reasonable amount of experience with different forms of technology, particularly in using multimedia systems.</skills>
