<persona name="Alice" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="Alice.jpg" >
  <activities>TV rocks Alice's world. Alice loves watching national and international TV, and, after work each day, enjoys nothing more than browsing some of the more esoteric TV channels from around the world, from Japanese Sci-Fi to Angus Buchan sermons in South Africa.

At home, her TV home entertainment system takes central stage in her social life, to the extent that her primary means of web-surfing and viewing photographs is the TV.

Alice is part of an online community of fellow TV addicts. She provides online services with details of her preferences, and allows services to keep track of her viewing habits. She is rewarded with suggestions about programmes of interest to her. Specifically, the selection available is based on her viewing history and the interests of others with similar viewing characteristics.</activities>
  <attitudes>To feed her TV addiction, Alice has built her own home-entertainment system. The system is an elaborate pipeline of different components, with eclectic input sources such as satellite dishes and PCs streaming programme information, and output devices such as speakers and, of course, her TV.

Her interests have made her technically adept enough to examine the specification of devices she might want to purchase to ensure they meet her quality of service expectations, and are compatible with her "cloud" of devices.</attitudes>

  <motivations>Alice likes to spend as much quality time as possible watching the TV, and has optimised the hardware in her lounge around this goal. When Alice wants to change channel, she will reach for whichever device is closest to her; this is invariably her smart phone, although she recently repurposed an old handset to see if she could use this as a remote as well! If Alice needs to use the web or chat online, she will re-purpose her desktop's wireless keyboard and use the TV has her monitor. To facilitate this, Alice makes sure her TV and peripheral devices are modern enough to be discoverable by her controlling applications.</motivations>
  <skills>Alice is comfortable configuring Audio-Visual equipment. This includes transcoding media from one format to another, configuring software for streaming over her home LAN, and setting up TV and satellite feeds into her home entertainment system.</skills>
