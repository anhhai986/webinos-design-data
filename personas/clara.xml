<persona name="Clara" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/irisuser/webinos/wp2/personas/clara.jpg" >
  <activities>Clara is a teenager who lives with her family. Clara has diabetes and in order to live a good life, she actively manages her diabetes by herself. For this purpose, she uses modern technology, such as a laptop and a smartphone. Together with her blood glucose meter she collects and stores the measured data on a cloud service which is accessible by her physician.</activities>
  <attitudes>Like most of the teenagers of her age, Clara wants to enjoy her life and have fun. She goes out with friends, eats unhealthy things and has an irregular daily routine. Being distracted by all the interesting things around her, she often forgets to measure her blood glucose level. As a result, her glucose level is too high on average. This is dangerous to her health. Even though her physician emphasises the importance of a good glucose level and the risks of a high glucose level, she is not caring enough. In fact, Clara is willing to manage her disease but she also does not want to give up the fun part of her life. Currently, she tends more to the fun part than to healthcare. She did not find her balance yet, but she is in the process of learning to cope with her disease.</attitudes>

  <excerpt>These applications help Clara analyzing her blood glucose levels to help her in controlling her disease. The applications could for example display all her glucose levels for a certain time period, display diagrams showing average values throughout a day, show statistics on glucose levels within target/below target/above target, etc. </excerpt>

<document_reference name="Transmits measured glucose levels to the Web application" contributor="Sven Lachmund" document="Remote Monitoring of Chronical Discease through Access to Medical Sensor Data and Sharing of Medical Files User Story" >
  <excerpt>The most common case is that the blood glucose meter is connected to the computing device and values are transferred when Clara starts the diabetes web application. It is also possible to have a continuous connection so that each measured value is instantly sent to the computing device.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Stores glucose values in the cloud" contributor="Sven Lachmund" document="Remote Monitoring of Chronical Discease through Access to Medical Sensor Data and Sharing of Medical Files User Story" >
  <excerpt>A Webinos enabled diabetes web application also has the possibility to store Clara’s blood glucose values in a diabetes file in the cloud. It is important that this file is stored in a secure manner and no unauthorized third parties have access to it.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Grants her diabetes physician access to her measured data" contributor="Sven Lachmund" document="Remote Monitoring of Chronical Discease through Access to Medical Sensor Data and Sharing of Medical Files User Story" >
  <excerpt>For example, all values handled by the diabetes web application could continuously be stored in her diabetes file in the cloud and made available to her endocrinologist, her nurse, her dietitian, etc. \n\nAlternatively, Clara can make her results available when she visits her diabetes doctor for her three-monthly check-up. A scenario is that Clara takes out her mobile phone and starts her Webinos diabetes web application. She goes to the “Sharing my file” page. The application automatically searches for Webinos enabled devices in the vicinity. The doctor’s mobile phone shows up on the list and Webinos automatically provides Clara with the necessary data to check the security of sharing the file. Clara can then choose to share her file with the doctor using this mobile phone.</excerpt>
