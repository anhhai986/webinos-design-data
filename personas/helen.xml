<persona name="Helen" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="Helen.jpg" >
  <activities>Helen is a 32 year old marketing manager for a publishing house in Brighton.

Helen has a 3 year old toddler, Eric, which she drops off at the nursery on the way to work each morning, and picks up at a fixed time on her way home. This is something Helen has to do because Scott, her husband, works in the City, so catches a train to and from work.</activities>
  <attitudes>Helen feels strongly about her role as a mother of a young family. Even though her job can be quite stressful and demanding time-wise, she feels it's important to maintain a healthy work-life balance. For this reason, she works regular office hours (partly to make sure she can drop off her child to/from the nursery, works with work media at the office only and, unlike most of her friends, LinkedIn is the only social network she uses at work.

The only time Helen transfers media between devices is when she is in the office and doing things like tranferring presentations and documents between PCs and laptops. Helen does, however, use the cloud to store snaps that she has taken of her family.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Although Helen wouldn't call herself technically literate, she has become quite adept at using the technology around her to streamline her working life. She uses a blue-tooth hands-free phone in her car, and makes sure the calendar on her phone (with both work and home calendar) is kept synchronised with her work laptop, PC, and the home media system her husband has setup.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Helen works hard to make sure her day-to-day life is as predictable as possible. Because of this, Helen wants to rely on the context-awareness features in her applications. She wants her data to be synchronised when it needs to be, and to be prompted when she (invariably) forgets things.</motivations>
  <skills>None</skills>
  <intrinsic>Helen's concern about her family can sometimes cloud her judgement or lead her to make access control decisions that, in the cold light of day, might not be best for her or Eric.  On a good day, however, Helen has an eye for seeing intricacies in contexts, and appreciating the sort of things that strangers might want to take advantage of.</intrinsic>
  <contextual>Thinking explicitly about how her family interacts with technology helps Helen think about how to access control data associated with these interactions.  Also, because little details that complicate thinking, Helen uses things like sketches and abstractions to support the access control decision making process.</contextual>
