<persona name="Anna" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="anna.jpg" >
  <activities>Anna is in the final year of an undergraduate medical degree. Breathing difficulties, coupled with a very mild form of Cerebral Palsy mean that some of her motor skills are limited and she is prone to bouts of fatigue. Because of her restricted mobility, Anna is dependent on the use of a wheel-chair.

Despite her disability, Anna is keen on socialising, and lives in an adapted halls of residence at her university, so she can get out and meet people.</activities>
  <attitudes>Although Anna had problems studying with her disabilities in school, her expectations about the accessibility of places, processes, and things have been raised during her time at university. These were raised in line with her desire to be more independent. Her local authority provides her access to a Personal Assistant when she occasionally needs help with shopping or other physically demanding activities, and she finds that many shops and places around university are becoming more accessible. As a result, Anna expects software and systems to be accessible enough for her to use.

As the world around her has become more accessible, Anna has grown to dislike being type-casted because she relies on a wheel-chair. When she can, as much for exercise as anything else, she will try to walk short distances without a wheel-chair. Moreover, as her graduation approaches, she has become increasingly wary of highlighting her disability too greatly. With the current economic crisis, Anna is concerned she might miss out on jobs if her CV or an application form suggests she might be too much of a burden.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Anna's desire for independence has given her a sharp eye for identifying ways that technology can improve her mobility. To reduce her reliance on her Personal Assistant constantly visiting her, she uses her mobile to keep in touch with her if she needs something. She also uses an electric wheelchair to get around, and is on the look out for any technology which might improve her studies and way of life, even if she has to pay for it herself because her local authority will not.

Anna realises, however, that she does not live in a perfect world and needs to forward plan if she does anything which she thinks might be out of the ordinary. If Anna needs to take a bus, she tries to find out if she can take a wheel-chair on it before she ventures out. Anna also tries to find out if new shops are accessible before she first visits them, especially when buying clothes; she does not want to find something she likes only to discover that there is nowhere accessible to try it on.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Being disabled, Anna often needs to deal with a lot of bureaucracy to get the care she needs, and would love for some of this to be automated. She is convinced that technology can help her reduce the amount of forms she invariably needs to complete to get her benefits, or the number of people she has to deal with in local government or her university to resolve issues which occasionally crop up.

Despite her self confidence, Anna always needs to think about what happens when things go wrong. Getting wheel-chair problems when out and about can leave her stranded because she struggles when walking more than a short distance.</motivations>

  <excerpt>A wheelchair isn't a disability, a disability is what puts you in the wheelchair.  The whole point of a wheelchair is to make your life easier.  Yes, in relation to 'normal' people it's difficult and awkward, but they give mobility to people who would be unable to move otherwise.  That's not really that hindering at all.</excerpt>

..I don't normally try on clothes in shops but had to on Friday as I needed it Satuday morning and the number of shops that didn't have disabled changing rooms was very high, I could get into the room but then couldn't shut the door, so thought about buying the item then going into the disabled toilet to try it on so could take it back if didn't fit, seemed like a lot of polava to be honest though.</excerpt>
