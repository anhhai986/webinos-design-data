  <excerpt>He has been asked to write several policies governing the e-books and the application itself.\n\nThe company has realised that a mistake was made in their original terms and conditions and a related data-access policy. He has to push a new version of these terms and a new policy to all customers.  \n\nHe is then asked to implement a new pricing model and also to update the prices of some books. \n\nFor certain books, users can pay nothing so long as they agree to advertising and report click-through frequency and a few other details.\n\nOne of Aaron’s concerns when collecting statistics on advertising information is that spoofing is prevented.</excerpt>

She may temporarily have a medical condition that she wants to track but does not want to share, or she may be shopping somewhere more risqué, or shopping for a surprise present.   She configures a new policy in webinos that will not keep records of what she is doing and where she is going, and will keep her devices hidden from nearby networks.</excerpt>
