<persona name="David" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="david.jpg" >
  <activities>From early age, David has been involved in a number of challenging (legal and illegal) activities. However, his minor sporting successes have not brought a very comfortable or profitable life. He has spent a significant part of his life as a young adult in jail.

His actual work as skilled car mechanics has positive facets: raised in a household of mechanics and car experts, he finds the work easy, and he can effortlessly achieve very good results in repairing cars. However, his troubled nature prevents him from being satisfied and he is unable to foresee a bright career.</activities>
  <attitudes>David was raised in family where talking about cars was the norm. His parents allowed his love of racing vehicles to bloom.

Another parental (David's father's, in particular) gift was the negative influence (build up on the father's disciplinary extremes) that cursed him with a youth of disorder and an unbalanced personality. This resulted in an inclination to commit crimes, break laws and rules, and be violent.

Some sporting achievements have made him fairly popular, but have had the unfortunate side-effect of encouraging his illegal activities: his self-confidence increased as well as his attraction to hazardous activities.

Due to his careless attitude and lack of consideration for consequences, he can perform actions that have potentially dreadful impact on others and possibly also to himself.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>His upbringing gifted him with a good competence in the working and internals of cars as he was involved in daily car trouble-shooting and discussion. This love for talking about cars and problem-solving led him to open and maintain a blog where car problems are dissected. Often, David give good advice and pretty good solutions to a problem in comprehensible and effective manner, due to his disposition to break up problems into simpler terms.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>David loves to be fast, he feels all life should be passed at increasing speed. In this sense, a growing feeling of non-satisfaction is growing within him. David's present work is boring, his pockets are empty (difficult to have any savings if you come and go from prison). Furthermore, he recently lost a chance of a career move.

A way to possibly collect some money more is tampering. Clever tampering! "Selective" tampering! Meaning a kind of damage that causes vehicles to develop a problem after some time, possibly in different parts. This means that he will be asked to fix a number of problems that happen at the same time, resulting in more work and even some well-paid overtime.</motivations>
  <skills>Apart car aptitudes, David also has some IT skills.
David is quite familiar with company's communication system and with vulnerability exploitation.</skills>

    <narrative>David has a deranged personality, and is not fully capable of evaluating the consequences of his actions. This is true also in terms of his own personal damage. His actions can lead to devasting result for himself, as the years in prison have demonstrated.

On the other hand, he is also fairly clever (in a frenzied way). His plan to tamper with car systems (including on board computers) has a non-negligible chance of success, at least in the short term. In the longer term, David will very likely face some more time in the local penitentiary.</narrative>
