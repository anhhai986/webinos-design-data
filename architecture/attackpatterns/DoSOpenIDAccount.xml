  <intent>Part of a larger attack to misuse user credentials or perform identity theft, an attacker deletes or changes the password on the user's OpenID account.</intent>

  <implementation>
    <description>Frankie is attempting to gain access to personal accounts on a range of popular websites, including email services and social networks.  He intends to deface public records of some people (those he knows and has taken offense to) and maybe to expose a few people who he thinks are arrogant and deserve to be knocked down a peg or two.  To do this, he is exploiting password recovery features and guessing commonly used "secret phrases" for openid accounts based on user names he knows, as well as some he has found on public forums.  This resets user passwords and, as a consequence, means that the real users can't authenticate against the OpenID providers.  Unfortunately for the victims, this also means that they have lost access to their webinos personal zone administration interface.  Later on, Frankie realises that some of his victims are running webinos, and he makes use of his access to their accounts to (in some cases) delete files and settings, and in other cases secretly add his own device to their personal zones.</description>
