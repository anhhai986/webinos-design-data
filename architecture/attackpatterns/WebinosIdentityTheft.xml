<attack_pattern name="Identity theft with webinos messaging" likelihood="Probable" severity="Critical"> 
  
  <obstacle name="Webinos account is misused to phish contact" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>An attacker uses their ability to log in to the user's email account to impersonate them and send phishing emails to their contacts.</definition>
  </obstacle>

  <obstacle name="Messaging API misused" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>Malware is given access to the messaging API which is then used to send messages and receive presumed-private messages</definition>
  </obstacle>
  
  <obstacle name="Malware installed" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>A piece of malicious software is installed by the end user</definition>
    <concern name="Widget Processor" />
  </obstacle>
  <obstacle name="Malware granted permission to access messaging API" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>The user grants a piece of malware inappropriately high permissions</definition>
    <concern name="Access Request" />
  </obstacle>
  <obstacle name="Permission prompt click-through" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>Users click 'ok' to all permission prompts and therefore do not realise they are granting inappropriate permission</definition>
    <responsibility name="User" />
  </obstacle>  
  <obstacle name="Bad trust decisions" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>The user makes a bad decision to trust a piece of malware.  This could be because they have insufficent information available to make a better decision.</definition>
    <responsibility name="User" />
  </obstacle>    
  
  <obstacle name="Online email account details compromised" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>The attacker gains knowledge of the user's account details which are sufficient for him to log-in and impersonate them</definition>
  </obstacle>  
  <obstacle name="Attacker obtains user password" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>The attacker gains the user's login password.  This may be through the password recovery system, compromise of a re-used password on another site, or otherwise.</definition>
    <concern name="OpenID credentials" />
    <responsibility name="3rd Party Service Provider" />
  </obstacle>    
<!--
  <obstacle name="Only one factor authentication used" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>The user's email account has only one factor of authentication: the password</definition>
  </obstacle>    
--> 
  <obstacle name="Second factor of authentication (SMS or email code) compromised" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>The attacker gains credentials provided by the second authentication factor (an SMS containing a short token, for example)</definition>
    <responsibility name="3rd Party Service Provider" />  
  </obstacle>    
  
  <obstacle name="SMS intercepted and relayed" category="Vulnerability">
    <definition>SMS messages are intercepted by malware with a subscription to the messaging API.  The authentication token is then forwarded to the attacker</definition>
  </obstacle>
