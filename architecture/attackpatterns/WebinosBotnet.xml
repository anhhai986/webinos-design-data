    <implementation>
    <description>Ethan creates a webinos botnet and enrols several personal zones using the following options: i) An implementation flaw is exploited in the widget renderer, which abuses its trusted relationship with the PZP to make arbitrary API requests and access remote services; ii) A method of enrolling rogue devices into personal zones is discovered which allows an attacker to join every personal zone. They can then install applications in every personal zone; iii) A PZP implementation flaw (perhaps a native API implementation) is exploited by an application in order to install native malware on the device. Because this API is commonly available, the malware spreads rapidly; iv) Native device malware (outside of webinos) steals PZP keys and credentials and is able to hijack the personal zone.</description>
