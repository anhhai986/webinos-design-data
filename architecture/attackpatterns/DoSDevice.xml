  <intent>Part of a larger attack, Ethan tries to drum-up interest in his own "battery life extender" application by rendering his victim's devices unusuable due to battery life problems that he has caused.</intent> 
  <motivation goal="availability" value="Medium"> 
    <description>The device rapidly becomes unavailable as battery life is spent too quickly</description>
