  <consequences>
  This attack is based on a protocol flaw, and would be a vulnerability in all deployments. As a result, any webinos user could be susceptible and there could be widespread loss of data and credentials, affecting the security of personal information and privacy loss.
  </consequences>    
  <implementation>
    <description>During enrolment of a PZP to a PZH, the user visits their PZH web interface to collect a short authentication token. This web interface is authenticated using standard web PKI and DNS. The enrolment process then allows the PZP to connect to the same provider and present the token. However, the PZP authentication process currently uses a different certificate (the PZH certificate not the PZH provider web interface). This is an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack. The same flaw may be present when a PZH is first instantiated.</description>
