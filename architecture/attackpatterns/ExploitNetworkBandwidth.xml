  <implementation>
    <description>Ethan has discovered that, invariably, webinos users have over-permissive convergence settings between devices used in the home and, with by altering the right settings, it is possible to change network service settings. This is especially useful given that some network providers, as part of their business model, allow users to change their bandwidth settings online via webinos. This is a boon for Ethan's botnet business the convergence affordances allow him to easily increase the bandwidth available to his botnet clients.

A number of botnet client machines were running webinos, so he tried connecting to one of them and running a customised webinos web service client to discover any available webinos services. Sure enough, he discovered a text input service running on a mobile phone. Ethan was able to easily connect to this and manipulate the machine owner's "use maximum bandwidth" setting. If he was lucky, the machine owner's network provider would automatically increase this home's bandwidth without the owner ever finding out.</description>
