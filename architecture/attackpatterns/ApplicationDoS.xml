  <intent>Harold has developed a webinos application he is very proud of.  Unfortunately it is not receiving much attention because another app (which he believes to be inferior) is extremely popular.  Harold decides to get rid of the competition, which he feels will be best for everyone: he gets the recognition he deserves and users get a better experience.</intent>

    <description>Users become unable to reliably use a certain app</description>

  <consequences>Depending on the application, users might simply no longer be able to use the app.  They might also lose access to some data.  The developer could lose money, reputation and social contacts.  The developer might lose their job.</consequences>
