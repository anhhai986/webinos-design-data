    <description>As Alice was walking away from the bar with her drinks, she narrowly avoided dropping one of her glasses as man brushed past her. "Sorry", he mumbled as he walked briskly towards the toilets.

David devised a new scam which took advantage of the recent take-off of NFC based mobile payment, and the new webinos platform that could link different apps and devices together. The scam involved dropping a leech mobile phone into someone's bag which contained a webinos enabled NFC phone. The leech would attempt to get the victim's phone to join his personal zone which, David estimated, would not be too difficult. Once in place, David could then purchase things via NFC, while webinos routed the request to the victim's NFC reader via the personal zone overlay network. David tinkered around with different devices, settings, and applications, and was quite surprised at how easy this scam appeared to be. Consequently, he would need to make the most use of this exploit quickly before other people got in on the act.

David's plan was to find somewhere where there would be lots of young but unsuspecting people who might not notice something being put into their bags. David decided a nightclub on a Friday night would be a good bet. As David entered the club at shortly after midnight, he noticed a large group of people mingling near the bar. As he approached, he noticed a large women trying to carry multiple drinks with a hand-bag slung around her shoulder. Confidently, with his leech device in hand, David walked towards this woman.</description>
